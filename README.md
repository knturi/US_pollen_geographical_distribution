Title: Runny Nose and Watery Eyes: Exploring Pollen Levelsacross the United States

Executive Summary: One of the criteria used to evaluate cities for livability is suitability of its environment for healthy life.  Allergy is a major acute and chronic health issue that affect people in The United States. A person considering to move to new place may think twice about the prevalence of an allegen s/he is sensitized to. This project summarizes pollen allergen information in easily accessible format in shiney application.

Motivation
When considering moving to new place, one of the considerations for evaluating livability of city is health risk. Allergy represents major health issue in united states. People may want to know if the allergen they are sensitised to is present when they move to new place. Moreover, current allergy test, which is based on the IgE (body's immune response) to the allergen, is universal and not tailored to the regional differences in allergen prevalence. For example, top pollen allergen species in  Nashville may not be top pollen allergen species in Atalanta or Seattle. Testing for Oak pollen allergen  may make sense in Nashville, but not in Memphis where ragweed is top pollen specie. Although, air pollen level is forecasted through weather channels, this flactuates with the weather itself. The historical pollen count data, which tells a better story, has not been compiled for allergen physicians and allergen test making companies in well organized and easily accessible manner.

Data Question
The question I wanted to answer with this project is that what pollen species are most prevalence in 1000 US cities?  If data is accessible, I will also include time series plot to show mean peak and low periods of pollen count over the years. 

Data Sources
For pollen count, I used Neotoma Paleoecology Database. The data was compiled from scientific publications of pollen counts through out noththe America and iceland locations from 2005-2015 by Whitemore et al. Whitmore, J., K. Gajewski, M. Sawada, J.W. Williams, B. Shuman, P.J. Bartlein, T. Minckley, A.E. Viau, T. Webb III, S. Shafer, P. Anderson, L. Brubaker. (2005). Modern Pollen Data from North American and Greenland for Multi-scale Paleoenvironmental Applications. Quaternary Science Reviews 24: 1828-1848. 				

Known Issues and Challenges
Some of this data may not be available for free or may not be the latest. However, allergy prevalence may not change by much from year to year.
